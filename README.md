I developed a dynamic, fully automated performance dashboard leveraging advanced Excel capabilities to streamline the analysis of complex retail sales data. The solution delivers real-time insights into key performance indicators (KPIs)—including sales, costs, and profit—supported by highly interactive Slicers that enable seamless multi-dimensional filtering across the business.

Added Value:
This model significantly enhances strategic decision-making and reduces reporting time by over 90% through intelligent data automation and optimized analytical workflows.
